# Triangle-BattleShip-Game
The aim of the project is to develop a one-player game in which user creates a triangle battleship, calculating geometrical properties of the ship and surviving from a random shot. If the ship survives, the player gets a point which is the area of the ship. 
1.	The game starts with a menu which includes five options: (i) entering ship location (ii) listing the properties of the ship, (iii) shooting at the ship, (iv) showing high score table, and (v) exit. 
2.	The shape of the ship is a triangle and it can only be placed in the first quadrant (x>0, y>0) of the Cartesian coordinate plane. The player will enter the coordinates of three vertices (named A, B, and C) of the triangle. The program should control the validity of the triangle.
3.	The game area is 30 * 12 units. The ship will be shown on the coordinate plane.
4.	The program should list the following properties about the battleship: 
Basic Properties:
(i)	The size of the ship (length of the edges)
(ii)	The perimeter of the ship	
(iii)	The area of the ship
(iv)	The angles of the ship
(v)	Median points of the ship (intersection of a median and a triangle edge)
(vi)	The centroid of the ship	

Advanced Properties:
(vii)	The length of the bisector of the point A
(viii)	The area of the inscribed and circumscribed circles
(ix)	The type of the ship
•	Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene
•	Acute-angled, Right-angled, Obtuse-angled

5.	It will be a random shot. If it hits the ship, the ship sinks.
6.	If the ship survives, the player will get the point which is the area of the ship.
7.	At the end of the game, the program should print the high score table. If the player gets a score that is high enough to be on the table, the name of the player is entered and his/her score is shown on the table. 
If the player gets a score that is equal to a score in the table, the name of the player is placed under the old one.
